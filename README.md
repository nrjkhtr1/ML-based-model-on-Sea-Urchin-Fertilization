# ML-based-model-on-Sea-Urchin-Fertilization

## Introduction

Sea urchins are small, spiny marine organisms. They are important to their ecosystem as they help to maintain the number of algae in the ocean.
They are also called the grazers of the ocean. Algae are important because they produce oxygen. The fertilization of sea urchin species
Strongylocentrotus purpuratus varies with varying pH.

The samples were collected from three sites namely Fogarty Creek(Oregon), Bodega Marine Reserve(California) and Santa Barbara(California). The 
temperature was held constant to see pH effects. Unique male-female pairs originating from three sites with similar mean pH but different 
variability, fertilization was tested across a range of pH (7.61- 8.03).


## Dataset

The dataset we used was published by PANGAEA in February 2017. We used the CSV format of the data for our analysis. The area covered by the dataset is of North America.
